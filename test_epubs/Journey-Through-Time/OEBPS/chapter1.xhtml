TEN THOUSAND MILES away, in the early afternoon, Locille was not very close to Egerd at all. "Sorry," she said. "I would like to. But—".
        "But he didn't want you working on it. Or anything. He wants you to
take the day off—get off the campus—and he wants me to stay with you."
"Huh." He stared glumly at the window. "Hum." He made tasting
motions with his lips and tongue and made a face.

Egerd stood huffily up. "What's the record?" he said angrily. "Ten weeks? Good enough. I'll be around to see you again along about the first of the month." He stalked out of the girls' dayroom.
Locille sighed, but as she did not know what to do about Egerd's jealousy, she did nothing. It was rather difficult to be a girl sometimes.
For here's Locille, a girl, pretty enough, full of a girl's problems. It is a girl's business to keep her problems to herself. It is a girl's business to looked poised and lovely. And available.
